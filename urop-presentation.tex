    	\frametitle{Current Problems}
 
   	   	\begin{itemize}
   	   		\item Hard to manage and/or print the work from all the students. 
   	   		\item Parts of the work might get lost or overlooked.
   	   		\item Work might not be submitted on time or in a good format.
   	   		\item No easy way for a DoS to look at a students work.
  	   	 \end{itemize}

    	\frametitle{A bin for every supervision}
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item All the work for a supervision is organized in a single place
    	    \item We can generate PDFs in different formats with all the work of the students  
    		\item Work is kept for ever. 
    		\item Work is easily accessible anywhere, anytime.
    	\end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}
    	\frametitle{What it means for the student}
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item Work will be submitted as either PDF, TxT or as scanned images.
    		\item Students will have to select the questions on their work. This can be done:
    		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Automatically using some special markup for the ones that are computer readable (PDF, TxT)
    			\item Manually using a web interface we provide.    			\end{itemize}
    	\end{itemize}    	
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}
    	\frametitle{Back to marking work}
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item We provide PDFs in different formats (by student, by question, etc)
    		\item Those PDFs can be annotated using Xournal (or other tools)
    		\item Once reuploaded we detect and store the annotations made on the pdf.
    	\end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}
    	\frametitle{New ways to improve the supervision}
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item Students can review their marked work before the supervision.
    		\item Peer marking. Students can mark each others work in a bin.
